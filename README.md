# myReactWebsite

Project Preview, Deployed to Github Pages: https://ali-khaled-949.github.io/myReactWebsite/

This project is a sample made by Ali Khaled, an e-commerce website designed to showcase various functionalities typical of online stores. It's built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. The website features include a homepage with products displayed in a grid, a product detail page, a shop page similar to the home page but dedicated to shopping, and a contact us page with a non-functional form for demonstration purposes. The project incorporates React Router for navigation between pages, styled-components for styling, and fetch API for retrieving products from a mock API, indicating a focus on modern web development practices and interactive design.
